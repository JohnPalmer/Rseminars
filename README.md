RonR! First Seminar Series

R is a free programming language designed to apply statistical techniques and produce data visualization. Among its endless capabilities, R is famous among statistical software for its flexibility in creating functions, packages, data visualization, for being open source and for offering a wide range of statistical tools. In the first series of seminars we aim at introducing you to the R programming language, making the transition as seamlessly as possible.

The outline of the seminar series is as follows:

In the first seminar we will show you the power of R. We will go through the strengths of R and how you can use it to obtain meaningful results. In the next session we will go through the building blocks of the R language and understand some traditional R features. We will guide you through simple examples on how the R language works.

After you’ve mastered these building blocks, in the third seminar we will start to get our hands dirty by cleaning a dataset. We will go through each step of manipulating a dataset and making it as workable as possible. Next, we’ll produce everything from contingency tables to regression output. 

The fourth seminar will be specialized on R graphical capabilities. Lastly, we will learn some commands that will allow you to make your data analysis much easier such as loops, conditional executions, among others.
We intend to make some, if not all the seminars, as interactive as possible. For that, we plan to lean R by using R.  We will develop the exercises inside the program so we can play and practice anytime we want. Each session might have different or even paired instructors that will present and practice the examples with you.

Don’t worry if you have:
1. Little to no experience with R.
2. No previous programming experience or no previous programming with other statistical commercial software.
3. Limited statistical knowledge

However, we do have a requirement:
4. You are motivated enough to put up with some initial (and continuing) frustration :)



Seminars Program:
Please, bring your laptop with R already installed (and possibly with the battery fully charged).
All seminars are free but If you’re interested in participating, please email Jorge Cimentada
